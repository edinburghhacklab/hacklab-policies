Lone Working Policy
===================
Director Responsibilities
-------------------------

The Directors are responsible for:

- Ensuring that all members are aware of this policy
- Ensuring that a Lone Worker gets help identifying risks and is given help to work safely
- Ensuring that appropriate support is given to members involved in any incident
- Providing or identifying personal safety equipment where it is felt to be desirable

Member Responsibilities
-----------------------
Members are responsible for:

- Taking reasonable care of themselves and others affected by their actions
- Following guidance and procedures designed for safe working
- Reporting all incidents that may affect the health and safety of themselves or others and asking for guidance where appropriate
- Reporting any dangers or potential dangers that they identify or any concerns they might have in respect of working alone

Guidance for Risk Assessments of Lone Working
---------------------------------------------

General Arrangements
--------------------

- Provide adequate channels of communication in an emergency
- Identify tasks or settings which present a special risk to the lone worker
- Set up reporting and recording procedures

Monitoring Safety Issues
------------------------

If something goes wrong or something is broken, report it to the Directors.

Lone workers must report incidents (including near misses and accidents) to the Directors.

Concerns about personal safety in any situation must be referred to the Directors as a matter of urgency.

The Directors must exercise vigilance and ensure that incidents are not overlooked or ignored.

Lone Working Procedures
-----------------------

- If you plan to be alone in the Hacklab, inform a trusted person (such as a spouse, partner, or friend) in advance. Let them know how long you expect to be there and notify them once you have left the space.
- Keep your phone with you, or another means of communication.
- Don't work alone if you are not confident in your ability to do so safely.
- Consider locking the door when in the space
- Do not open the door to someone you don't know
- Avoid tasks involving physical risk (e.g. large power tools). If unavoidable, let someone know what you are doing and inform them once the task is complete
- Beware: a trivial action may carry high risk (e.g. standing on a chair to reach something)

Much of this policy is based on the excellent work of Norwich Hackspace.
