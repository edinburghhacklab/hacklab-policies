COVID-19 Policy
===============

This Hacklab policy includes the measures we are actively taking to mitigate the spread of coronavirus and the steps you must follow if you wish to use the Hacklab facilities.

You are requested to follow all these rules diligently, to ensure a healthy and safe facility for our community. 

This coronavirus (COVID-19) policy is subject to regular review and changes. If the policy is updated, the directors will update you as soon as possible by email to the members' mailing list.

This policy is the responsibility of the Edinburgh Hacklab directors. Please email them with any questions or comments at <directors@edinburghhacklab.com>

Intention
---------

The intention of this policy is to protect members by reducing the risk of transmission of COVID-19. The Hacklab has not yet had a COVID-19-related incident, and this policy was written with the intention of continuing that trend. 

Scope
-----
This policy applies to all Hacklab users including members, guests, visitors and members of the public. It defines who may use the Hacklab premises and the procedures that must be followed before, during and after your visit to ensure the safety of our community.

Please note that we cannot completely eliminate the risk from COVID-19, however, we are doing all that is reasonably practical to reduce the risk. 

Symptoms of Coronavirus
-----------------------
NHS Scotland provides a COVID-19 Symptom checker at https://www.nhsinform.scot/self-help-guides/self-help-guide-coronavirus-covid-19 <https://www.nhsinform.scot/self-help-guides/self-help-guide-coronavirus-covid-19>. Use this, or other materials provided by NHS Scotland, to keep up-to-date with the latest understood symptoms of COVID-19.

If you, a member of your household, or a member of your support bubble are experiencing **any** of the these symptoms then **DO NOT VISIT THE HACKLAB** and consult the NHS for advice.

COVID-19 Procedures
-------------------
The following procedures apply to all users visiting the Hacklab premises. These rules are mandatory for all users of the space unless specified as optional or advisory in the text.

Who Can Use The Lab?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The rules for using the lab depend on the local tier applied in Edinburgh: https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-protection-levels/ <https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-protection-levels/>

**At Tier 4:**

The lab will be closed to members. Access to the lab whilst closed will be considered on a case-by-case basis: Contact the directors to organise this. 

**At Tier 3:**

The Hacklab will open to members. 

Where you would otherwise be lone working or require assistance with a project for health and safety reasons (e.g. manual handling) you may bring one member of your household (including any bubble) to assist you. You must ensure that the household member has read and agreed to this policy, provides contact details (in the instance that contact tracing is required) and that you book exclusive use of the room you are working.

If a non-member requires access for any other reason, please contact the Hacklab Directors.

**At Tier 2 and below:**

Before Your Visit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Please plan your visit carefully. As a Hacklab user you are responsible for managing your own risks and you may have specific health concerns making you more susceptible to COVID-19. You should consider the risks to yourself and whether your visit is necessary.

Rules:
- You must book your use of the lab before entering the premises
- Do not attend the Hacklab if you are required to self-isolate or quarantine, or if you believe you are exhibiting symptoms of COVID-19 (e.g. if you or a household member contracts Coronavirus, if contacted by Test and Trace or in the case of returning from travel)

Advice
- Check the current COVID-19 zones and travel guidance
- Consider how you will get to the Hacklab
- Plan your work carefully as you must fully clear and tidy your work area before your booking ends
- Consider bringing extra clothes as the Hacklab can be cold when windows are open for ventilation
- Bring your own PPE

How To Book
^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to allow members to communicate with eachother their intentions for using the space (to avoid dissapointments when travelling to find the space is at capacity), a booking system has been implemented. 

The booking system is available at `https://booking.ehlab.uk/ <https://booking.ehlab.uk/>`_ and you can login with your normal Hacklab username and password. You can reset this password at `https://admin.ehlab.uk/ <https://admin.ehlab.uk>`. 

To ensure access to the lab is fairly available to all members, some limits have been set. If you believe you need to exceed these limits, contact the directors who can provide exceptions reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 

- You can only book a slot within the next two weeks
- You are limited to a maximum of 10 hours of future reservations per week. This ensures fair use by preventing large blocks of bookings. As your bookings pass you can book more future slots, up to the 10 hour maximum.
- You can only book 50 hours per month in total

Each room has a maximum safe capacity which must be respected to ensure 2m social distancing:

- G1 (Main space) - Two people with access maintained for one person to use the kitchen/shop or pickup mail/printing at any time
- G2 (Laser cutting) - Individual occupancy only (or two people from one household/support bubble)
- G8 (Workshop) - Two people. Please note in booking if you need any specific machines to help coordinate
- G11 (Storage, 3D printers and servers) - Single occupancy with access to storage area for one additional person. When 3D printing, please don't stay longer than necessary. If you need access to the store, knock first due to limited space.
- G14 (Electronics) - Individual occupancy only (or two people from one household/support bubble)

All spaces must be booked with the exception for necessary/transient access to the kitchen, shop, printing, mail or storage.

For G1 and G8 we recognise that members who are at higher risk may require exclusive access to the room. You may book both areas if this is required although please note that access to the kitchen/shop may be required by other users. If you need an additional quota to do this then please let the directors know.

If you cannot attend you must cancel your booking as soon as possible to let others attend.

During Your Visit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
When you arrive, please follow any one way systems or directions given by Summerhall staff. Access may be made through the side gate or by reception.

Rules:

- Wear a face covering on the premises at all times, unless you have a medical exemption. This includes within Summerhall corridors and communal areas. The rule applies within the work areas, even with exclusive use, to ensure the safety for the next user. 
- Sanitise or wash your hands on arrival. Hand sanitiser is provided, and soap and hot water are available in the G1 kitchen.
- Use your token on all doors, even if they are on the snib. This logs your visit to enable contact tracing if required.
- Keep 2m from other users at all times unless they are a member of your household.
- Open windows and turn on the ventilation fans (available in G1 and G8) to ensure rooms are well ventilated.
- Please knock and stand back from a door if you need access to another room (e.g. for a tool or accessing storage). Leave enough time for the user to answer before entering
- Use single use or personal PPE where possible. Disposable earplugs are provided and all users may take one pair of safety glasses for their personal use (please keep in your storage box). Please contact the directors regarding Welding operations or the Grinding shields for a specific risk assessment and safe cleaning procedure.
- Do not stay beyond your booking
- Before leaving, fully tidy your work (take it home or leave it in your storage box) and clean your work area including any tools, equipment and PPE used
- Close windows and doors at the end of your visit for security

Guidance:

- Check your work area is clean before working. Cleaning products are provided if you wish to use them before starting work. Please email the directors if the area you have booked is untidy or unclean (with photos if possible). This helps us ensure fair accountability. 
- If someone without a booking is using the area, please safely ask them to clear up and leave and inform the directors.
- If you require the toilet, ensure single occupancy and wash hands thoroughly after use
- Regularly sanitise or wash your hands during the visit
- Any waste, especially where it may be contaminated with bodily fluids (e.g. tissues, paper towels, bottles and cans) must be placed in the bins. Gloves and a mask should be worn when emptying bins and hands thoroughly cleaned afterwards
- Avoid touching your face or face mask unnecessarily
- Doors can be left open to increase ventilation and air the room while tidying
- Leave plenty of time to clean and tidy your work area
- Consider installing the Protect Scotland App on your phone.

In An Emergency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
- If you need to give first aid to another user, gloves and a mask must be worn. If possible, you should help the casualty to treat themselves while maintaining a distance. All incidents must be reported immediately to the directors.
- In the event of a fire, please exit the building promptly by the nearest fire exit. Maintain 2m social distancing at the muster point

Please consider the additional risks of lone working and plan accordingly. We advise ensuring that someone knows when you are using the Hacklab and checking in with them when complete.

After Your Visit
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you develop COVID-19 symptoms in the 10 days following your visit you must email the directors to enable contact tracing to take place: You should also contact the NHS. 

Enforcement
-----------
It is forseeable that in some circumstances (perhaps due to carelessness, ignorance of the risks, or other factors), members may sometimes fall short of the expected standards of behaviour and cleanliness required to keep the Hacklab a safe space. 

In light of this, the following procedures have been developed. It is important to note that these are not intended to punish anybody, and instead are designed to ensure the safety of the rest of the membership and keep the Hacklab COVID-free.

Minor Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^
We hope minor issues can be dealt with by way of an informal reminder from other users without any escalation.

Examples:

- Neglecting to wear a mask (unless exempt)
- Entering a room at capacity
- Hygiene issues
- Minor social distancing failures (while wearing masks)

What to do:

- In the first instance, remind other users of the expectations in this policy from a safe distance.
- Inform the directors of refusal or continued breaches, or if you feel uncomfortable / unsafe.

Moderate Breaches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
We operate a three-strikes policy with increasing severity. If you find issues such as housekeeping and tidiness when you arrive at your booking or if someone else is using the space, please email the directors (with photographs if possible).

Examples:

- Repeated minor breaches
- Refusal to use the booking system
- Next user finds room untidy/unclean

What to do:

- Inform the directors

What the directors will do:

- Investigate the situation (e.g. check door logs) and speak to users
- In the first instance, remind members of the rules and gain agreement that they will comply in future
- In the second instance, issue a final warning that behaviour must improve and any further incidents within a specified time will result in further action. The time period is at the discretion of the directors
- A third breach will result in a temporary suspension of membership and removal from the access control and booking systems for a time at the discretion of the directors. Membership payments will not be due for any suspension longer than 1 month
- On return, conditions may be issued to ensure improved behaviour. Continued non-compliance may result in termination of membership.

Serious Breaches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Any serious issues should be immediately brought to the directors as they may require rapid action. Access may be temporarily suspended pending an investigation

Examples:

- Blatant refusal to comply with COVID policies (e.g. large groups using the lab, parties, putting others in immediate harm)
- Using the lab with COVID symptoms or while you should be isolating
- Violence, abuse or harassment of other members or Summerhall staff/residents
- Intentional endangerment of others 

What to do:

- Make yourself safe
- Inform the directors immediately

What the directors will do:

- Temporarily suspend access
- Investigate the situation and interview those concerned
- Take appropriate action
- On return, conditions may be issued to ensure improved behaviour.
