Electrical Safety
=================

Any electrical equipment that has the potential to cause injury is maintained
in a safe condition.

All users of equipment must perform basic visual checks on electrical equipment
prior to use to ensure there is no damage to plugs, cabling or equipment
casings. Any issues should be reported as a fault and the equipment taken out
of service.

Equipment should be appropriately fused.

Fixed Electrical Supplies
-------------------------

Summerhall are responsible for the safety of the fixed electrical installation
and this must not be modified by members.

Members should note that Summerhall circuits are not protected by RCDs and
plug-in type RCDs should be used where necessary.

Any damage to the fixed electrical supplies should be immediately reported to
the Directors who will inform Summerhall management.

Portable Appliance Testing (PAT)
--------------------------------

PAT testing will be carried out on a regular basis on electrical equipment in
the Hacklab.  The schedule will be agreed by the directors based on risk
assessment and industry guidance.

PAT testing may be carried out by trained members in line with the :doc:`PAT
Testing Code of Practice <pat_test_cop.rst>` Records must be kept of these tests.
Failed equipment should be labelled and taken out of service for repair or
replacement.

Any individuals bringing equipment into the lab for use on a regular basis
should seek to have it PAT tested.

Counterfeit, Non CE Compliant and Home Built Equipment
------------------------------------------------------

There is a high risk from equipment that fails to meet European safety
standards.  This may be equipment ordered from eBay and AliExpress but also
includes some items such as low cost phone chargers which are often imported
with fake compliance certificates.  Home built equipment also poses a high
risk.

Counterfeit equipment should not be used in the Hacklab. It can often be
identified by spelling mistakes or incorrect symbols on the device. Plugs may
not be of the correct dimensions and fuses incorrectly manufactured in these
cases.

Home built and other high risk equipment should be carefully checked and must
be PAT tested before general use by members.

Extensions and Adaptors
-----------------------

Only fused multi way extensions connected to a wall socket via a cable may be
used. These must not be daisy chained. Long extensions should be secured to
prevent wear and not become a trip hazard.

Live Working
------------

It is recognised that there will be circumstances where it will be necessary
and justifiable for work to proceed either on or near to exposed live
conductors, such as terminals, switches and controllers, etc. This must be
fully risk assessed and those carrying out such work deemed competent to do
so. Please see :doc:`Live Working Code of Practice <electrical_live_working.rst>` for details.

Faulty Equipment and Equipment Repairs
--------------------------------------

All faulty equipment should be taken out of service and labelled to prevent
use by others. A notification should also be made on the members email list.

Hacklab members should only attempt to repair equipment if competent to do so
and should ensure that equipment is fully tested including a PAT test before
returning to service.

Equipment must be deenergised for repair and locked out where necessary. Live
working procedures should be followed if live testing is necessary. RCDs
must be used when testing functionality of repaired equipment.
